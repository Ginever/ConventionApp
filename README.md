# ConventionApp
An App designed to streamline the sign-in and data collection process in NZ conventions.
This web app is currently in alpha and is a prototype to demonstrate a potential solution and is missing key components such as:
- An admin console to view, edit, add, delete and download data
- An Android app to allow for easier offline use
- A method to add CSV (Google Sheets and Excel) files to the database
- Password recovery and the ability to sign in with Google, Facebook, etc.
- Figure out how to timestamp people being stamped on and off grounds (this is quite easy)

The system is also lacking a lot of pretty and the user experience is buggy and just generally terrible the things that I feel are most important to be improved are:

- Split the form onto multiple pages as to not overload the user. I haven't done this as it complicates the flow of the app considerably but it needs to happen
- Add or remove data fields, the ones I have used are temporary and can be easily changed
- Lots of polish
